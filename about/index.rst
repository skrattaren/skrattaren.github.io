Who am I?
*********

My name is Николай Шуйский (nowadays I prefer to romanize it as *Nikolaj
Šujskij*), and I'm a programmer with biological background from Russia.  I'm
interested in stuff like Linux and other free software, cultural and linguistic
history, heavy and traditional music, various sporting (basketball!) and outdoor
(backcountry skiing!) activities and probably something else I
couldn't recall right now.  Among other things I consider myself anarchist,
atheist and communist.  All in all, quite a merry chap, too!
