Who am I?
*********

My name is Николай Шуйский (nowadays I prefer to romanize it as *Nikolaj
Šujskij*), and I'm a programmer with biological background from Russia.  I'm
interested in stuff like Linux and other free software, cultural and linguistic
history, various sporting and outdoor activities and probably something else I
could recall right now.  Among other things I consider myself anarchist,
atheist and communist.  All in all, quite a merry chap, too!
