I am great warrior of OpenSource, indeed. On Thu, Oct 18 Kubuntu_ and Xubuntu_
7.10 were released and in that evening I've downloaded all eight *.iso*-images
and put it out in local network for people who cannot download them by
ourselves.  And today I managed to re-upload two images to other server for Far
East Ubuntu users (-%E
