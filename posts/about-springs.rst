Spring has came (to northern hemisphere, that is). That is to say,
calendar one, and it doesn't seem true one to me. We count years by sun,
so all the seasons of year should be determined by solar events,
solstices and equinoxes (equinoces?). Astronomers believe that spring
begins on vernal equinox (20 Mar in 2011). But that's a bit strange to
me personally, since that way daytime increases only in winter and
spring, and summer and autumn are both time of "darkening". I'd prefer
to consider that equinox (or solstice) are middles of theire seasons, so
spring is a quarter of year, when daytime growth is fastest; summer is a
quarter of year with the biggest daytime etc. Either way, the first day
of real, solar spring is three weeks away from today. Before or after.
