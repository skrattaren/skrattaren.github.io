.. title: RSS reader: BazQux
.. slug: bazqux

Since the death of *Google Reader* (may the googler who doomed it burn in
non-existing hell) I've been looking for new RSS reader. What I need is:

* Web-app (or some kind of synchronization between machines);
* good keyboard navigation;
* responsiveness;
* design which lets me read stuff and gets out of the way.

That's all I can think out at the moment. Strangely enough, that seems to be
quite a lot: I looked at `The Old Reader`_ and Feedly_ and several others, but
wasn't satisfied (though used `The Old Reader`_ for more than half a year). And
now `BazQux`_ has implemented `keyboard shortcuts`_ for selecting feeds, and I
gave it a spin again. And I actually liked it. It costs $9 per year, but you
can evaluate it for free, it's written in Haskell by a Russian programmer and
has quite a bunch of features.
