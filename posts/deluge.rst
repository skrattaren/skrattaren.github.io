If you want to set up torrent-downloading server and control it with
GUI-clients (even on Windows) read `my article on Gentoo
Wiki <http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Deluge>`__. If you're using other
\*nix or Linux distro, you'll need to think a little bit, of course, but
nevertheless one might find it useful.
