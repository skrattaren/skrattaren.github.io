There's a good word in Old Icelandic, **hraustr** (meaning *brave,
strong*). Sounds conformably. It's believed to be derived from
Indoeuropean root, and this root is presented in Russian as **"крот"**
(*[krot]*, a mole)

Ancient Teutons and Slavs seem to me to have a little bit different
conception of strength and valour (-%E
