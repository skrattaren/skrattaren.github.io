Probably you came there following the link in my forum signature
promising to explain my *user title*. Well, "omni-nationalist" is a term
invented by myself (-:E At first I used "pan-nationalist" term, but
found it to be already existing and unsuitable for my needs. So, little
excurse to Latin was undertaken, and a brand hot-coined term is
ready-to-use (-:E

So, who are the people calling themselves omni-nationalists? Yep, the
term is somehow linked with usual nationalism, but has one major
distinction: omni-nationalist is **nationalist of all nations**. As you
can know or ask me or see on my `About
page <http://my.opera.com/Sterkrig/about/>`__, I'm Russian, therefore
I'm a little bit Russian nationalist. Also I have Balto-Finnic roots, so
I'm a great Votic, Izhorian, Karelian *etc.* nationalist. When the
question is about modern celts, then I appear to be hard Irish and
Scottish nationalist. Just similarly I could be referred to as
Icelandic, Faroese, Dakota, Zulu, Indian, <...> nationalist.

Well, now you can see, what's my point about. I believe that every folk
with its culture and language is dramatically important, so that worths
to be uneasy about it. Thanks for patience and attention (-:E
