| Just a note for those who looks for info on Gentoo & PostgreSQL (like
I did today):

-  yes, as you might be already suspecting, PostgreSQL has been split
-  [STRIKEOUT:yes, there's `a little
   howto <http://gentoo-wiki.com/PostgreSQL/Install/New>`__] there was
   one. Just install *dev-db/postgresql-base* (if you don't need server;
   also it's a dep for lots of packages, for example, those with
   USE="postgres") or *dev-db/postgresql-server* (PostgreSQL server)

| Got stable now, old-style packages are masked and will be removed.
