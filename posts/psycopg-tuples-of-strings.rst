Today I was fiddling with `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__
(v8.3, if anyone is interested) database from Python using famous
psycopg2, but suddenly got stuck in unexpected place. Had switched to
`bpython <http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/>`__ shell I saw the
following:

::

    >>> cur.execute('''SELECT (parent, level) FROM "MsgElems" WHERE msg_id=1;''')

    >>> cur.fetchone()

    ('(0,1)',)

*SELECT* returned tuple of string, one string. Now that's what I call
unexpectedâ€¦ I didn't find anything neither in Python DBAPI PEP nor
psycopg docs, but after some time a bright idea came:

::

    >>> cur.execute('''SELECT parent, level FROM "MsgElems" WHERE msg_id=1;''')

    >>> cur.fetchone()

    (0, 1)

Watch out. Meanwhile I'll try to find out, what triggers such weird
behaviour, and if it is weird at all.
