Digging through my ebook reader's memory, I've stumbled upon book
hitherto quite unknown to me, „Shantaram“ by Gregory David Roberts. So
I've read it (that's what books are for, ain't them?). Well… It's one of
the most impressing books that I have read recently (along with „Doctor
Zhivago“). I will not retell it, read the Wikipedia or something if you
want to know the plot (but what for? Don't spoil the reading!). But the
book is great. Life, people, good people, good things in common people,
war, (of course!) love… Modern literature without dirt, sex, drugs and
violence on every other page. Book that gives you something to think
about without showing off intelligence. If you heed my advice, read it.

    Anyone who walks away from *Shantaram* untouched is either heartless or
    dead or both.
