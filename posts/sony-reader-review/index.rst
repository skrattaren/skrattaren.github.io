I've recently bought `Sony Reader
PRS-T1 <http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/portable-video/portable-media-players-recorders/sony-reader-prs-t1-1037776/review>`__.
Excellent reader, rest assured of that. But cover is a must-have for
such a thing, so I chose Sony PRSA-CL10B. "Let it be light!", I thought.
Oh yes, there is. The problem is that the cover is crappy by itself.

-  It is soft: sags easily down to screen itself
-  It lacks any lock: can't be fixed in neither opened nor closed state;
   no press stud or magnet or anything, cover is more or less loose
-  It's bloody expensive (more than 40% of Reader price); considering
   aforementioned points, I'd call this ridiculous

I'm just glad I haven't decided to buy "light-less" (a *bit* cheaper)
version of that cover, because LED light is the only thing I like about
it. Oh, and the Reader is great. Just choose cover wisely, remembering
what I wrote here.
