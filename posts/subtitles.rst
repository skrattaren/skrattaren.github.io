If you watch anything in foreign language, here's simple trick for
you.

.. TEASER_END

When subtitles are on all the time, then your (mine at least) eyes
constantly swivel down to text, so that you're bound to miss something.
On the other hand, you might misheard or misunderstand and take a peek
in subtitles. Here's how I've decided to deal with it: set subtitle
delay to a couple of seconds and turn them off. In case of
emergency^Wneed to consult them, just turn them on again, by that time
the desired moment would appear on screen. How to do it in mplayer:

-  select subtitle with *j* key;
-  set delay with *z*;
-  turn off subtitles by pressing *v*, then use it again to turn them
   on/off.
