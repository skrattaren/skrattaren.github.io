Terry Pratchett seems to have a thing about accordion players. I've got a
couple of friends playing (or used to play) accordion, so I have collected
these quotes from Discworld books for them (and hopefully other people) to
enjoy (-:E

This list seems to be quite complete (insofar as my pdfgrep_ tells me), but
feel free to point out anything missing. Too bad you sometimes have to know the
book context to get the joke fully, but here they are anyway.

Interesting Times
-----------------

    Six Beneficent Winds … was not a wicked man. True, he played the
    accordion for amusement…


The Truth
---------

    | 'Twenty-six people are mentioned by name.'
    | 'As accordionists?'
    | 'Yes.'
    | 'Won't they complain?'
    | 'They didn't have to play the accordion'


The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents
--------------------------------------------

   Of course there weren't just rat plagues — sometimes there were
   plagues of accordion-players, bricks tied up with string, or fish…


   People could tolerate rats in the cream, and rats in the roof, and
   rats in the teapot, but they drew the line at tap-dancing. If you
   saw tap-dancing rats, you were in big trouble. Maurice had reckoned
   that if only the rats could play an accordion as well they could do
   two towns a day.


(Maurice „and His Educated Rodents“ enact "rat plagues" in small towns
for their "stupid-looking kid" with a flute to save the day. Just as it
goes in rat-piper stories)

Monstrous Regiment
------------------

   The last three Abominations were against rocks, ears and accordion
   players. Okay, I might be with him on the last one, but…


Unseen Academicals
------------------

   During the interval, I believe that there will be a marching display
   by the Ankh-Morpork accordion band, but I suppose these things are
   sent to try us.
